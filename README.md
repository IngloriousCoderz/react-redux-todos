# React-Redux Todos

A React-Redux todos mini-application made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app shows some of the features included in both React and Redux. By default it shows a React-only app, but you can quickly switch to the full app by changing a line in the `index.js`.

## Usage:

```sh
npm start
```

To switch from React-only to React+Redux, change the following line:

```js
import App from './ui/ReactApp.jsx';
```

into:

```js
import App from './ui/ReactReduxApp.jsx';
```
